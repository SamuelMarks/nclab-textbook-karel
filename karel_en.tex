{\bf About this Textbook}\\[4mm]
This free textbook is provided as a courtesy to NCLab users. 
It will help you to develop algorithmic thinking and acquire essential
principles of procedural programming. Karel is a famous educational language 
created (and still used) at the Stanford University. After taking this course, 
you will be able to transition swiftly to Python and other modern programming 
languages. \\[4mm]

\noindent
{\bf Become a Co-Author}\\[4mm]
We do not want to publish the textbook with a commercial publisher since this 
would make it unnecessarily expensive for students who are the target audience. 
Feel free to contribute to the textbook with any material or suggestions. 
There is never enough illustrations and exercises, and there always are bugs 
to report. Instructions for contributors can be found below.\\[4mm]

\noindent
{\bf How to Contribute (for \LaTeX \ and Git users)}\\[4mm]
\noindent
The textbook is written in \LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system that 
you can learn and use in NCLab. In the future it will be possible to contribute to 
the textbook directly in NCLab, but at this time, the sources are stored 
in a public Git repository {\tt nclab-textbook-karel} at Github (http://github.com). \\[4mm]

\noindent
{\bf How to Contribute (for all others)}\\[4mm]
\noindent
We will gladly accept new interesting exercises for Karel and/or Python, as well as
new images of good quality that will make the textbook more interesting to students. You
can send those at any time via email to {\tt pavel@femhub.com}.\\[4mm]

\section*{Foreword}
This course provides a gentle yet efficient and comprehensive introduction to modern algorithmic 
design and computer programming. It features {\em Karel the Robot}, a famous educational programming 
language that was created at the Stanford University. The robot collects gems in a maze and helps 
students develop advanced algorithmic skills using a handful of simple commands that do not involve 
math. 

With Karel the Robot, learning feels more like playing. Without being exposed to technical details 
of conventional programming languages, soon you will master essential principles of modern 
algorithmic design and computer programming.
Could such an introduction be done with a conventional programming language? Yes, but 
you would be obscurred and slowed down by technicalities, not mentioning that it would 
not be so much fun. 

The course starts out in Manual mode (Level 0) where the robot can be guided via 
clicking on five buttons {\em Go} (make one step forward), {\em Left} (turn left), {\em Right} 
(turn right), {\em Put} (put a gem on the groud) and {\em Get} (pick up a gem from the ground).

\caption{Sample game {\em Diamond Mine} in Manual mode.}
\label{fig:f1}
\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}
\noindent
In the next level which is called {\em Bridge to Programming} students keep solving 
problems by typing the commands {\tt go}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, {\tt put} and {\tt get} 
instead of clicking on buttons. 

The need for higher functionality such as loops, conditions, and custom commands arises 
naturally as game goals become more complicated. 
Students learn quickly that it is advantageous to break complex tasks into smaller 
ones, which is one of the most important principle of computer 
programming. The textbook is written by programming experts, and in addition to 
advanced programming skills the students gain an overview of good and bad 
programming habits.

\end{figure}
\noindent
The syntax of Karel the Robot is very close to Python -- in fact Python feels like Karel's
older brother. The transition from Karel to Python is as seamless as the transition from 
one Karel's Level to another.
